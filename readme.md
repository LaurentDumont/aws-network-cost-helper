# What is this?
 - AWS will bill you for bandwidth in many different directions.
 - This can be a shock from on-prem where bandwidth/network is absorbed as part of the overall infrastructure.
 - The AWS calculator makes it a bit hard to visualize the flows and direction of traffic.
 - We need to find a way to educate and upskill architecture and service team.
 - Network traffic is well suited to a visual representation.
